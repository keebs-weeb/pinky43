# pinky43 - Put Your Thumbs to Work!

This is a project I have been developing for a little while now.  

It stems from pain in my pinky fingers from typing all day, something I have heard referred to as 'Vim Pinky' (or just RSI).

## The Design

I have design this keyboard with a few things in mind:
* Reduces the use of my pinkies
* Has a form factor I like
* Has a typing angle I like

## The Catalyst
I noticed that a normal spacebar takes up far too much real estate - 6.25u or 7u!  I don't need that much space.  
All I need is about 1.5u by then 'B' and 'N' keys, where my thumbs naturally fall.
Then, I needed to remove all modifier keys that my pinkies hit often (Enter, L&R Shift, Ctrl, Caps, Tab) and move them into a cluster by my thumbs.

Given the amount that I used each modifier, I positioned them on the bottom row to ensure that nothing felt clunky to me.
